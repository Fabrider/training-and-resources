# Joy Diversion

1 Preparation

## 1.1 Requirements
* Room with tables, whiteboard, ideally projector.
* Historical maps of local area.
* Backpacks (see below for more info & contents)
* Some token to act as team mascot - we use toy zoo animals, which works well.
* Postits and pens
* Refreshments etc

## 1.2 Maps

We run Joy Diversion from central Manchester, and cover the city centre and Salford too. As such we have a variety of historical maps that are used to explore the local area, find aything of interest, to start conversation and to proper expeditions for the day. 

We have a large mounted map of central Manchester dated from 1918 as well as a variety of old OS maps from 1848.

These are great conversation starters. Some ideas are to look for familiar road names - do they exist? What has changed? What is different?

The maps should be laid out from the start, and as people arrive they can dip striaght into exploring them.

## 1.3 Backpacks
Teams are given a backpack each for their expedition. Our backpacks include:
* Compass
* Small torch
* Dice with N/S/E/W compass points on (for inspiration!)
* Whistle
* Plastic bags / labels / rubber gloves / tongs for collecting and cataloguing any interesting finds
* Notepad and pencil for notes / sketching.
* String 
* Emergency plasters and foil blanket
* Envelope with inspiration cards written on them
* Emergency transport map

These items give the day a fun sense of adventure and exploration. The 'inspiration cards' should remain sealed, to be used if team becomes really stuck or need a boost. They contain suggestions such as 'Look Up - what do you see?" or tell people to roll the dice and follow the direction given. 

You can change up contents or add anything to suit your own needs or ideas.

## 1.4 Team Mascots

As attendees start to propose ideas for potential expeditions, teams should start to form. When teams go out on expeditions, we ask them to live tweet their journey, taking photos of what they find. Each team selects a toy animal to become their mascot. That animal becomes their team name. They then photograph the animal in the various places they visit, along with a suitable hashtag - ie Team Giraffe use hashtag #ODM_Giraffee (where ODM=Open Data Manchester). 

Of course, you may wish to use something other that toy animals as your mascots, but we've found them to work well and people enjoy using them.
