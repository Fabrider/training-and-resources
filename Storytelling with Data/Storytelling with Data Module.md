# Storytelling with Data 
*Created by Dirk Slater(@fabriders) and Mor Rubinstein (@morchickit)*

## What is it about? 
During this workshop we will build compelling stories from datasets we have mapped. We will start by focusing on the ‘who’ we are telling the story to and how to craft a narrative that is compelling to them. We will then explore the maps of our data, think about the story they tell us, and then draft stories for our audiences.  We will also review best practices for using stories crafted from data to build a better understanding of our audiences.

## Workshop Prep
You can run this workshop after a data expedition, to create a follow up and make use of the outputs, but it can also be a stan dalone one. We recommend to read (or listen) to the resources that are connected to this workshop prior the workshop and to brush a bit about the principles of [User Centered Design](http://www.fabriders.net/hacking-user-centred-design/). If you are doing this activity after a data expediton, review the outputs from the expedition and prepare a document of "What we have learned so far" so the group can catch up on it.
