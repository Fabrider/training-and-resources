# Data Expedition Guide

---
## 1.1 You will need:
* Wifi (obvs)
* Whiteboard 
* Projector if possible for sharing!
* Lots and lots of postits
* Paper and markers
* Data & Dragon template. Printed copies, enough for group
* Data Pipeline - five or six sets, depending on how many people are attending.
*  Camera for documenting

## 1.2 Your expedition attendees will need:
*Laptops
* Ideally a dataset or data-based issue that they or their org is having trouble with.

## 1.3 Rules for the day 
Set out at start:
* Be open to learning;
* There no silly questions;
* Use this as an opportunity to teach (so don’t touch other people’s computer as this will inhibit their learning);
* Have some fun while learning;
* Look out for going down a rabbit hole: notice when you are not progressing in a timely manner and try something else.

## 2.1 Welcome
Aim of exercise: Introduce everyone to the day
Time (est): 10-15 mins
Housekeeping / fire alarm procedure etc
Why are attendees here? Are they simply here to learn new skills? Or do they have specific dataset / question that they wish to explore? This will affect the the way the rest of the workshop goes! (It’s always preferable if they have dataset or question they wish to address)
How the day will run
Introduce team ie yourself, any other team members.
Explain Data Expeditions usually run over a weekend or over weeks if online. Today’s workshop will only be taster, and don’t expect to come away with a finished project. You will come away with more questions - but that’s the nature of it!

## 2.2 Ice Breaker: Data & Dragons
Aim of exercise: Ice breaker, self-appraisal of skill sets, form groups.
Time (est): 15 mins
Introduce the idea of Data & Dragons
Fill out form as an example. 
Use the skillsets to form groups where all skills are covered (this may not be possible if it’s an event of, say,Manchester all analysts! 
Remind people that they are probably more capable than they give themselves credit for!
Get them to present themselves to their groups. Pick a few to share with the whole workshop. Ask questions like “Did anyone score a 3 for ‘Analyst’?’

## 2.3 The Data Pipeline
Aim of exercise: Introduce the data pipeline methodology, and the non-linear approach
Time (est): 15 mins 
Define
Find
Get
Verify/Clean
Analyse
Present
Give each group set of cards with above. Ask to put them in order. 
After a few minutes, give them some post it notes / arrows shapes. Get them to think in non-linear terms.
Ask groups to share their pipelines.
Ideally they should be: 
Non linear
At any point you may need to go back any of the previous steps.
Best example is snakes and ladders.

Point here is to get them to understand that although the pipeline is an ideal process/methodology, rarely will you work through it in order.
At any point you may come to a dead end, data may not exist, or data may throw up other questions or perspectives which can force you to start over. 

## 2.4 Spectogram 
Aim of exercise: Get groups to think about questions they are interested in, starting point for their expedition. 
Time (est): 15 mins

This is particularly useful if attendees have come with no specific dataset or questions in mind.
Get groups to come up with controversial questions, ideally based around where they live or the area in which they work.
Ie ‘Manchester should invest in more roads and not in public transport’.
Get groups to stand up and form a line, one end being ‘disagree totally’ and the other ‘agree completely’. 
Ask people to explain their choice.  People can move along the spectogram if person’s view changes their mind!

## 2.5 Define & break into groups
Aim of exercise: Start the expedition
Time (est): 5 mins

Use the most engaging questions from spectogram as a starting question, to ‘define’ the question they want to investigate.
People might want to swap groups here depending on what they’re interested in investigating.
If people have come with own dataset/question in mind, then grousp should be split based on this.
Try to have good spread of scout/engineer/analyst/storyteller skills where possible!

## 3.1 Wall of Data
Aim of exercise: Create a resource of online databases
Time (est): Ongoing throughout the expedition

Introduce this idea at the start of the expedition.
Using a white board or postit notes, people add any new data resources they find.
Over the day, create this should fill up.
Constantly remind people throughout the day to add any new sources to the wall.
At end of day, photograph or document & share with group. 

## 3.2 Toolbox
Aim of exercise: Create a resource of useful tools or software (preferable free/open!)
Time (est): Ongoing throughout the expedition
As with the Wall of Data, this is only aimed at useful tools or software that may help people open/process/clean data files i.e. OpenRefine for processing json files for Excel

---
## 4.1 The Expedition
Aim of exercise: Find/explore the dataset, go through the data pipeline as much as possible!
Time (est): 4-5 hours (or as long as you can)

Groups attempt to explore their dataset, look for new data, access, analyse etc.
This can go on for as long as you have.
Remember that most expeditions take a few days, or weeks if online. This is a taster.
Share skills where needed.
Faciliator should regularly go around, help out, ask questions etc at all times.
Remind people to share on Wall of Data / Toolkit!

## 4.2 Sharing of progress
Aim of exercise: Share where people have got to so far
Time (est): 5 mins

About half way through allocated expedition time, get together and get groups to share where they are so far
What questions have come up? What barriers? Have they had to re-define their question? 
Can anyone from other groups help with an issues people have?
Don’t forget the Wall of Data / Toolkit!

## 4.3 Presentation

Aim of exercise: Present findings
Time (est): 5 mins per group

Present findings from expedition.
Some people may not have got very far - this is OK!

## 5.1 Notes
Keyboard Hot Lava: imagine other people’s keyboards are hot lava. If you need to teach someone something, do not touch their keyboard. Get them to do it themselves - it’s how they will learn!
