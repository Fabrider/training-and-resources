  ## Workshop Prep
  
  You may want to have previously carried out a Questions Workshop. We strongly recommend this to allow more time for the expeiditon itself. However, if time is limited you can do a condensed version at the start of the day. Ideally you will enter the workshop with questions already proposed.
  Glossaries should also be sent out to attendees in advance to prime them for terminology that may be used in the workshop.
