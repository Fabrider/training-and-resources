## 1.1 Types of Data Expeditions
* With single organisations, with a specific dataset and/or questions
* Mix of orgs and ability of attendees
* Open event, members of public
* Train the trainer format

## 1.2 Attendees should bring:
* Laptops
* A dataset or data-based issue/question that they wish to explore. This could be defined in the Data Questions workshop, or you may wish to define the problem on the day.

## 1.3 Materials required:
* Wifi (obviously)
* Whiteboard / flip chart
* Lots and lots of postits
* Paper and markers
* Any other materials depending on what exercises you will be completing
* Lunch and refreshments
* Camera (or phone) for documentation

## 1.4 Pre-expedition

You can find some [lesson plan examples and templates here](https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources/tree/master/logistics). We recommend using the basic structure found on the examples and in the section below, swapping out exercises and sections depending on the type of event you are running, the audience/attendees, amount of time available etc.

If you are able to, you may want to run a [Data Questions Workshop](https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources/tree/master/Questions%20Workshop) to begin to determine the questions that participants will explore on the day. This can save a lot of time, and allow more time to the expedition itself.

It is also recommended to send out the [glossaries and data pipeline](https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources/tree/master/glossaries) information in advance to familiarise attendees with terminology that will likely be used on the day.

## 2.1 Environment
(Some information on the room, the layout, keeping a warm and friendly environment that puts people at ease and is conducive to collaboration and learning)

## 2.2 Rules for the day 
Set out at start:
* Be open to learning;
* There no silly questions;
* Use this as an opportunity to teach (so don’t touch other people’s computer as this will inhibit their learning);
* Have some fun while learning;
* Look out for going down a rabbit hole: notice when you are not progressing in a timely manner and try something else.
* Keyboard Hot Lava: imagine other people’s keyboards are hot lava. If you need to teach someone something, do not touch their keyboard. Get them to do it themselves - it’s how they will learn! 

## 2.3 Agenda/Structure of day
* Welcome
* Ice Breaker
* Skill assessment (data explorer)
* Questions - this could be a complete defining of questions, so extra exercises such as spectogram may be useful. Or it may be looking at questions from Data Question workshop & breaking down.
* Expedition itself
* Sharing

* Throughout day, resources and tools should be added to the 'Wall of Data/data chest' and 'Toolbox'.

## 3.1 Welcome
Aim of exercise: Introduce everyone to the day
Time (est): 5-10 mins
- Housekeeping / fire alarm procedure etc
- How the day will run

## 3.2 Ice Breaker / Data Explorer
Aim of exercise: Ice breaker, self-appraisal of skill sets, form groups.
Time (est): 15 mins
- recommend the use of the [Data Explorer exercise](https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources/tree/master/data-explorer)
- depending on time available and group size you may want to add your own additional ice-breaking exercises here.

## 3.2 The Data Pipeline
Aim of exercise: Introduce the data pipeline methodology, and the non-linear approach
Time (est): 15 mins 
* Use the [Data Pipeline methodology found here](https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources/tree/master/data-pipeline).
* Give each group set of cards with above. Ask to put them in order. 
* After a few minutes, give them some post it notes / arrows shapes. Get them to think in non-linear terms.
* Ask groups to share their pipelines.
* Ideally they should be: 
- Non linear
- At any point you may need to go back any of the previous steps.

Emphasis here is to get them to understand that although the pipeline is an ideal process/methodology, rarely will you work through it in order.

At any point you may come to a dead end, data may not exist, or data may throw up other questions or perspectives which can force you to start over. 

## 3.3 Define & break into groups
Aim of exercise: Start the expedition
Time (est): 5 mins

Use the most engaging questions from spectogram as a starting question, to ‘define’ the question they want to investigate.
People might want to swap groups here depending on what they’re interested in investigating.
If people have come with own dataset/question in mind, then grousp should be split based on this.
Try to have good spread of scout/engineer/analyst/storyteller skills where possible!

## 3.4 The Expedition
Aim of exercise: Find/explore the dataset, go through the data pipeline as much as possible!
Time (est): 4-5 hours (or as long as you can)

Groups attempt to explore their dataset, look for new data, access, analyse etc.
This can go on for as long as you have.
Remember that most expeditions take a few days, or weeks if online. This is a taster.
Share skills where needed.
Faciliator should regularly go around, help out, ask questions etc at all times.
Remind people to share on Wall of Data / Toolkit!

## 3.5 Present findings

Aim of exercise: Present findings
Time (est): 5 mins per group

Present findings from expedition.
Some people may not have got very far - this is OK!  

---
## 4.1 Wall of Data
Aim of exercise: Create a resource of online databases
Time (est): Ongoing throughout the expedition

Introduce this idea at the start of the expedition.
Using a white board or postit notes, people add any new data resources they find.
Over the day, create this should fill up.
Constantly remind people throughout the day to add any new sources to the wall.
At end of day, photograph or document & share with group. 

## 4.2 Toolbox
Aim of exercise: Create a resource of useful tools or software (preferable free/open!)
Time (est): Ongoing throughout the expedition
As with the Wall of Data, this is only aimed at useful tools or software that may help people open/process/clean data files i.e. OpenRefine for processing json files for Excel

## 4.3 Sharing of progress
Aim of exercise: Share where people have got to so far
Time (est): 5 mins

About half way through allocated expedition time, get together and get groups to share where they are so far
What questions have come up? What barriers? Have they had to re-define their question? 
Can anyone from other groups help with an issues people have?
Don’t forget the Wall of Data / Toolkit!

---
## 5.1 Spectogram 
Aim of exercise: Get groups to think about questions they are interested in, starting point for their expedition. 
Time (est): 15 mins

This is particularly useful if attendees have come with no specific dataset or questions in mind.
Get groups to come up with controversial questions, ideally based around where they live or the area in which they work.
Ie ‘Manchester should invest in more roads and not in public transport’.
Get groups to stand up and form a line, one end being ‘disagree totally’ and the other ‘agree completely’. 
Ask people to explain their choice.  People can move along the spectogram if person’s view changes their mind!
