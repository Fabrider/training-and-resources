WORK IN PROGRESS

This guide is a write up from ODM's first data expedition run in Manchester in August.
Intention is to develop it into full guide for running a data expedition with interchangable modules. Users take resources in the main training and resources folder, pull them together into their own expedtion that suits their own needs.
