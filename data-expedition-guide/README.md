WORK IN PROGRESS

This guide is a write up from ODM's first data expedition run in Manchester in August.
Intention is to develop it into full guide for running a data expedition with interchangable modules. Users take resources in the main training and resources folder, pull them together into their own expedtion that suits their own needs.

[facilitator-guide.md](https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources/blob/master/data-expedition-guide/facilitator-guide.md) aims to give facilitators an in-depth guide as to what a Data Expedition is, how to modify it for your own needs, how to prepare, including using the Data Questions workshop etc.

[data-questions.md](https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources/blob/master/Questions%20Workshop/Questions%20Workshop.md) guides you through the preliminary data questions workshop.

[data-expedition-guide.md](https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources/blob/master/data-expedition-guide/data-expedition-guide.md) takes you through the main data expedition day workshop.

All other materials and resources referred to in these documents are available in the main [training and resources folder](https://github.com/OpenDataManchester/training-and-resources) and are linked to directly in the guides.
