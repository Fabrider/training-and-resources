Data Pipeline: Asking Questions, beginning of the process.

# Questions Workshop Facilitator's guide
## Steps in the Data Pipeline:
Asking Questions, beginning of the process.

## Workshop goals:
1. Make people feel ownership, control and agency of the data pipeline process.
2. Teach people how to ask research questions.
3. To create a focus on the data expedition.

## Duration: 2.5 - 3 hours (including break)

## Number of attendees - 5-10

## Distribution of skills -
All skills - storyteller, analyst, designers, coders, scouts, but can also be done only with the storytellers.

## Workshop agenda:
(15 min) Intro - Mor - (Investigate how 360G can help with your questions, and why we won’t make a map.
“a map is a tool - not an answer”
 Constructive selfishness
(10 min) Getting to know one another - Their name, what they do and “If they had one question to ask the ruler of the universe what will it be?”
(30 min) Fish Market - write for each post it on what they want to solve  - write as much as you can and then categorize it to big themes and vote on them.
(30 min) Break-out (2 or 3 groups) - choose a goal, what is the end goal you want to achieve?  Work on questions - look at the proposed questions - do they help to achieve the goal?
A.  If not write new questions:
 Guidance:
 1. Avoid jargon.
 2. Each question has one subject of research.
 3. Start with Why, How and What?
 4. Make sure it's an open ended question.
B. What sub-questions come out of them? [This is optional and can be explored at the expedition itself]
Guidance:
  1. Use who and where, when and what?
  2. Can be a close question.
[Facilitator's note: Try to divide it to groups of people who didn't know one another before the workshop. Facilitator to move around the groups to see if they need guidance.]
(10 minutes) Report back from groups.
(20 min) Break-out: What do we need to answer those questions? Very practical data
* Each group creates a list of what they would need
* Report back
(20 min) Summary and how we will work in the Data Expedition
