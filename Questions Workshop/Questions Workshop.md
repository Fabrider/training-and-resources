### Data Pipeline stage: 
Asking Questions, beginning of the process.

### Steps in the Data Pipeline
Asking Questions, beginning of the process.

### Workshop goals
1. Make people feel ownership, control and agency of the data pipeline process.
2. Teach people how to ask research questions.
3. To create a focus on the data expedition.

### Duration 
2.5 - 3 hours (including break)

### Number of attendees
5-10

### Resources
Post-it, markers, pens, flipchart, token (small stickers), laptops (optional), table, chairs. 

### Distribution of skills 
All skills - storyteller, analyst, designers, coders, scouts, but can also be done only with the storytellers.

### Workshop Prep
You might want to crowdsource the questions in advance to this workshop to create more buzz and participation from different stakeholders. It also help to demonstrate how to write good questions. We use [allofourideas](ttps://www.allourideas.org) open source platform to collect the questions. This is not a manadatory step. 

### Workshop agenda
*(5 min)* **Intro** - Why we start with a question and not with a tool (“a map is a tool - not an answer”)
Setting guidelines to the workshop:
1. This is a safe space;
2. No question is a silly question; 
3. Constructive Selfnesses 

*(10 min)* **Icebreaker / warmup** - Tell us your name, what you do and “If you had one question to ask the ruler of the universe what will it be?”
**[Facilitaor's note: this is to set the scene of how and why we are asking questions]** 

*(30 min)* **Fish Market** - write for each post it on what the goal / end game the participatns want to acheive at the end of the data pipeline process  - write as much as you can and then categorize it to big themes and vote on them.
Guidance: 
1. Think of big themes, give them one or two words. 
2. Make the theme into a goal sentence: 
 a. As X I want to do Y so I can do Z. *example: As an analyst I want to understand deprevation so I can alleviate poverty)*
3. Think of goals that are relevant to you, not to people who are not in the room. 

**[Facilitator's note: Take the Z parts of the sentences and put them to vote!]** 

*(30 min)* **Break-out** (2 or 3 groups) - choose a goal and work on questions. If you have questions in advance, look at the proposed questions - do they help to achieve the goal?
A.  Write new questions:
 Guidance:
 1. Avoid jargon.
 2. Each question has one subject of research.
 3. Start with Why, How and What?
 4. Make sure it's an open ended question.
B. What sub-questions come out from the questions above? [This is optional and can be explored during a data expedition]
Guidance:
  1. Use who and where, when,what or is?
  2. Can be a close question.
**[Facilitator's note: Try to divide the group to small groups of 3-4 people who didn't know one another before the workshop. Facilitator to move around the groups to see if they need guidance. Gently reminnd partipants that these questions will be used in the data expedition, so the questions should be focused.]**

*(10 minutes)* **Report back from groups.**

*(20 min)* **Break-out** What do we need to answer those questions? Very practical data that would be used in the expedition.
* Each group creates a list of what they would need
* Report back

*(20 min)* Summary and how we will work in the Data Expedition
 1. Workshop owners to write a blog post that will be published up to a week before the data expedition and will descirbe the questions that the expedition will try to answer and why we decide on these questions. Facilitator can help in the process by write a summary and notes of the session. 
 2. This blog post should be emailed to all data expedition participants prior to the event.
 3. The questions will be presented in the data expedition by the one of the people who were in this workshop.
